                    <p class="text">
                        South Korea is one of the countries in which reading news via online channels is the most common
                        way and,
                        of course, has its own unique way of online news consumption. Search engine companies like
                        Naver, the country's biggest
                        search engine, run its own online news platform by curating articles provided from a variety of
                        sources alongside open comment sections. The corporates neglect the comment sections, easily
                        plagued by
                        inappropriate and hateful remarks. Cut to the chase, I recently found some interesting phenomena
                        in those remarks,
                        commenters of which accuse one another of “Joseonjok" — a term coined by Joseon the last dynasty
                        of South Korea
                        and Jok meaning ethnic group — saying they are attempting to overturn the public opinion when
                        other’s opinions
                        are not in line with theirs.

                    Defined as Chinese of Korean descent who are regarded as one of the 50 minor ethnic tribes, It is
                    technically
                    not a derogatory name. Before there was Joseonjok, they were called “Dongpo", the literal definition
                    of which
                    is siblings who were born to the same mother, widely used to call Koreans living overseas. It has
                    been replaced
                    with Joseonjok because of immensely increasing antipathy against inclusivity within the term and
                    China over the
                    years. The chart is a clear example that shows the surge in usage volume of the term since 2020.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    As you might have noticed from the chart, it was not only about South Korea. Pew Research Center
                    said that
                    distasteful views of China had reached its unprecedented peak in the wake of pandemic in many
                    countries for
                    supposedly mishandling with COVID-19.

                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    But views have continued to sour and today, and unfavorable views of China are at a historic high of
                    80%
                    according to 2022 research by the institution. South Koreans answered China’s involvement in
                    politics in their
                    country as the top concern while China’s policies on human rights were described as a very serious
                    problem more
                    often than other issues in other countries.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Does the Chinese government interfere with South Korea’s politics? Why does this hatred flow down 
                    to Chinese expatriates we once believed to share a uniform ethnic identity then? But there might be 
                    two more possible reasons for it.

                <p class="text">
                    It was March 2020, when harsh feelings against China were soaring for 2019 novel coronavirus, one
                    anonymous user
                    in Ilbe, a notoriously far right anything-goes forum, claimed that they are part of Chinese Koreans
                    ordered to do
                    online operations of dividing the public by writing pro-China posts and comments, which was quickly
                    picked up by
                    traditionally conservative news media and made headlines.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    The internet companies denied the accusation and released records of Chinese IP being accounted for
                    only 0.5%.
                    Former United Future Party, current ruling party renamed People Power Party, stood firm and went
                    further with
                    the next step by filing a criminal complaint in March 2020, the result of which has not been shared
                    yet until 3 years
                    later at this moment.

                <p class="subtitle:5">First Visible Immigrants in An Intensely Exclusive Society</p>
                <p class="text">
                    For decades, immigrants had been nearly invisible to Koreans. They were thought to only exist in
                    factories and farm
                    fields in rural areas, taking dangerous low-waged jobs. Korean Chinese broke the tacit rule,
                    flooding and blending
                    into a long-forbidden space since the Act on the Immigration and Legal Status of Overseas Korean was
                    introduced.
                    They have a huge advantage, being fluent in Korean, widely hailed by mid-to-small sized companies
                    and industries
                    suffering shortage of labor force.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Many scholars stated that the mechanism of biases and discrimination works differently here in
                    Korea: It was often
                    pointed out that Koreans adopted lenses of orientalism in the beginning through which perceiving the
                    world and deeply
                    internalized materialism played a big role too. But they also say that the reason Korean Chinese are
                    especially
                    targeted is because they make up the largest number of immigrants, being the most visible outsiders
                    experiencing racism
                    barely surfaced or even addressed in the closed society before any other groups of immigrants do.

    <p class="subtitle:5">How media promoted hatred against Joseonjok</p>

    <p>From 2010 through 2019, South Korean culture had a renaissance. The country started to emerge as a culture house in the early 2000s, not only producing creative k-pop music and original shows but also well-regarded films. In particular, for the film industry, the 2010 era seemed to decorate its finale with international awards and prizes when Parasite, a satire movie about capitalism by Bong Joon-Ho, swept the Canne and Oscar. 
    </p>
    <p>Presenting itself with the very high quality and maturity, the industry was blamed for insensitive portrayal of immigrants at the same time. In 2017, Josenjok immigrants group made a collective statement to plead suspension of screening of 청년경찰 in theaters, saying it fueled hatred toward Joseonjok and aroused unnecessary tension between Koreans and Chinese. In the movie, 대림-dong where predominantly Joseonjok resided was described as such a town plagued with violent crime that even police can’t dare to control.

        <div class="steps-container">

            <div class="step">
                <p>18 movies were produced in the 2010s with Korean Chinese characters appearing,
                    out of which 13 works portrayed them as villains, hit-men, traffickers, gangsters, thieves,
                    and undocumented aliens.
                    </p>
            </div>
            <div class="step" id="step2">
                <p>The other 5 movies depicted Joseonjok as "normal" people or in a more diverse way, but not in a way of depicting them as friendly ordinary neighbors.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="step" id="step3">
                <p>Actually the perception that Joseonjok is highly involved with crimes does not align with reality. Published by the National Police Agency, the 2022 Crime Statistics shows that chinese crime rate is 1.2%, even if narrowed down to violent crime, it’s 1.17. It’s hard to conclude that the number of crimes committed by Chinese is distinctly high given that 1.6% of the population is Chinese.

            </div>
            <div class="step" id="step4">
                <p>“In fact, in society, minorities are often caught up in bad things. Even in Korea, people from that side of the world often commit violent crimes, which is why Korean movies often feature such settings,” Kwak Kyung-taek, director of Resurrected Victims where a Joseonjok character was depicted as a killer, answered a question about a controversial issue of them making an appearance as villains again in an interview in 2017. “As a storyteller, I think I had no choice. I couldn’t give up on things like Chinatown as a fictional space in that sense. A movie has to be plausible, and if you think about these things too much, you can’t do that. If I have the opportunity to tell their story someday, I want to do it right, and I’ll make up for it then,” he added.
