			South Korea is one of the countries in which reading news via online channels is the most common way and, of course, has its own unique way of online news consumption. Search engine companies like Naver, the country's biggest search engine, run their own online news platform by curating articles provided from a variety of sources alongside open comment sections. The corporates neglect the comment sections, easily plagued by inappropriate and hateful remarks. There has been this remarkable trend in online remarks, commenters of which accuse one another of “Joseonjok" — a term coined by Joseon, the last dynasty of South Korea, and Jok, meaning ethnic group — saying they are attempting to manipulate the public’s opinion when other’s opinions are not in line with theirs.

		<p class="source"> The data was collected from <a href="https://mlbpark.donga.com/mp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MLBPARK</a>, an online baseball fan community with predominantly far-right male users. This chart shows that the usage of the word, Joseonjok, skyrocketted nearly 5 times in 2020 and still stayed in the similar range of volume, around 3,500, as of 2022. </p>
		<p class="column">
			Defined as Chinese of Korean descent who are regarded as one of the 50 minor ethnic tribes, despite its current pattern of usage, it is technically not a derogatory name.  Before there was Joseonjok, they had preferred being called “Dongpo", the literal definition of which is siblings who were born to the same mother, widely used to call Korean expatriates. It has been replaced with Joseonjok since antipathy against inclusivity within the term and China grew  immensely over the years. The chart is a clear example that shows the uptick in usage volume of the term since 2020. 
		</p>
		<p class="column">
			But why does this hatred flow down to Joseonjok we once believed to share a uniform ethnic identity with then?
		</p>
		

		<h3 class="column">China Gate and Never Verified Claims</h3>
		<p class="column">
			It was March 2020, when harsh feelings against China were soaring for 2019 novel coronavirus, one anonymous user in Ilbe, a notoriously far right anything-goes forum, claimed that they are part of Chinese Koreans ordered to do online operations of dividing the public by writing pro-China posts and comments, which was quickly picked up by traditionally conservative news media and made headlines.
		</p>
		<p class="column">
			The internet companies denied the accusation and released records of Chinese IP being accounted for only 0.5%. Former United Future Party, current ruling party renamed as People Power Party, stood firm and went further with the next step by filing a criminal complaint in March 2020, though the result of investigation into China Gate has not been announced yet until 3 years later at this moment.
		</p>

		<h3 class="column">First Visible Migrants in An Intensely Exclusive Society</h3>
		<p class="column">
			Many scholars stated that the mechanism of biases and discrimination works differently here in Korea: It was often pointed out that Koreans adopted lenses of orientalism in the beginning through which perceiving the world and deeply internalized materialism played a big role too. But they pointed out that the reason Korean Chinese are especially targeted is because they make up the largest number of immigrants, being the most visible outsiders experiencing racism before any other groups of immigrants do that is barely surfaced or addressed in the closed society.
		</p>
		<p class="column">
			For decades, immigrants had been nearly invisible to Koreans. They were thought to only exist in factories and farm fields in rural areas, taking labor-intensive or low-waged jobs. Korean Chinese broke the tacit rule, flooding and blending into a long-forbidden space since the Act on the Immigration and Legal Status of Overseas Korean was introduced. They have a huge advantage, being fluent in Korean, to be widely hailed by mid-to-small sized companies and industries suffering shortage of labor force.
		<p class="column">
			As of last year, 4.37% of the population accounted for foreign aliens residing in Korea, out of which 37.8% are Chinese, followed by Vietnam, Thailand, the U.S. and so on. Though Chinese take up the biggest chunk of the foreign residents, it was only 1.65% of the population.

			From 2010 through 2019, South Korean culture had a renaissance. The country started to emerge as a culture house in the early 2000s, not only producing creative k-pop music and original shows but also well-regarded films. In particular, for the film industry, the 2010 era seemed to decorate its finale with international awards and prizes when Parasite, a satire movie about capitalism by Bong Joon-Ho, swept the Canne and Oscar. 
		</p>
		<p class="column">
			Presenting itself with the very high quality and maturity, the industry was blamed for insensitive portrayal of immigrants at the same time. In 2017, Josenjok immigrants group made a collective statement to plead for suspension of screening of Midnight Runners in theaters, saying it fueled hatred toward Joseonjok and aroused unnecessary tension between Koreans and Chinese. In the movie, Daelim-dong where predominantly Joseonjok resided was described as such a town plagued with violent crime that even police can’t dare to control.
		</p>
		<p class="column">
			Actually the perception that Joseonjok is highly involved with crimes does not align with reality. Published by the National Police Agency, the 2022 Crime Statistics shows that chinese crime rate is 1.2%, even if narrowed down to violent crime, it’s 1.17. It’s hard to conclude that the number of crimes committed by Chinese is distinctly high given that 1.6% of the population is Chinese.
		</p>
		<p class="column">
			“In fact, in society, minorities are often caught up in bad things. Even in Korea, people from that side of the world often commit violent crimes, which is why Korean movies often feature such settings,” Kwak Kyung-taek, director of Resurrected Victims where a Joseonjok character was depicted as a killer, answered a question about a controversial issue of them making an appearance as villains again in an interview in 2017. “As a storyteller, I think I had no choice. I couldn’t give up on things like Chinatown as a fictional space in that sense. A movie has to be plausible, and if you think about these things too much, you can’t do that. If I have the opportunity to tell their story someday, I want to do it right, and I’ll make up for it then,” he added.
