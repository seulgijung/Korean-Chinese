                        South Korea is one of the countries in which reading news via online channels is the most common way and, 
                        of course, has its own unique way of online news consumption. Search engine companies like Naver, the country's biggest 
                        search engine, run its own online news platform by curating articles provided from a variety of 
                        sources alongside open comment sections. The corporates neglect the comment sections, easily plagued by 
                        inappropriate and hateful remarks. Cut to the chase, I recently found some interesting phenomena in those remarks, 
                        commenters of which accuse one another of “Joseonjok" — a term coined by Joseon the last dynasty of South Korea 
                        and Jok meaning ethnic group — saying they are attempting to overturn the public opinion when other’s opinions 
                        are not in line with theirs.

                        Defined as Chinese of Korean descent who are regarded as one of the 50 minor ethnic tribes, It is technically 
                        not a derogatory name. Before there was Joseonjok, they were called “Dongpo", the literal definition of which 
                        is siblings who were born to the same mother, widely used to call Koreans living overseas. It has been replaced 
                        with Joseonjok because of immensely increasing antipathy against inclusivity within the term and China over the 
                        years. The chart is a clear example that shows the surge in usage volume of the term since 2020.

                        As you might have noticed from the chart, it was not only about South Korea. Pew Research Center said that 
                        distasteful views of China had reached its unprecedented peak in the wake of COVID-19 in many countries for 
                        supposedly mishandling with COVID-19.

                        But views have continued to sour and today, and unfavorable views of China are at a historic high of 80% 
                        according to 2022 research by the institution. South Koreans answered China’s involvement in politics in their
                        country as the top concern while China’s policies on human rights were described as a very serious problem more 
                        often than other issues in other countries.

                    <p class="text">
                        Does the Chinese government interfere with South Korea’s politics? Why does this hatred flow down to Korean 
                        Chinese we once believed to share a uniform ethnic identity then? There are two possible explanations for it.

                Condo towers are scattered across the
                island. Draped in greenery, they dot the city skyline––yet remain empty. Many choose to purchase
                property in Forest City, but for most it will not even serve as a landing pad. The current
                occupancy rates are low: those who have bought in have been enticed by the prospective returns
                on their investment rather than the prospect of living there.</p><br><br>

                The liveliest place in town is the Forest City showroom on the main island: a large open space
                with mock-up condos, created so that you can almost imagine yourself living there. They are
                complete with scribbled post-it notes on unplugged fridges and models posing as family in framed
                photos. The showroom is busy with sales representatives, and prospective buyers, most of whom
                are visitors from China. A large gong sits in the corner and is hit in celebration each time a
                condo sale is closed—the only live music to be heard on the island. haha

                The developers advertise promises of a smart and green city which resolves many ills of urban
                life, from pollution to traffic congestion. Even an underground transportation network is said
                to be planned, leaving room for pedestrians above ground.

                Although economically enticing, this project presents significant environmental and social cost.
                Swimming at the beach, as tempting as it sounds, is not recommended because of the risk of
                crocodiles roaming. Their habitat was disrupted to make way for the condos; before swaths of
                sand were posed in the area, it was covered in dense mangroves home to a rich variety of
                wildlife. Being built entirely from scratch, it is a resource-intensive endeavor. Its
                construction is dependent on migrant laborers who live in shared housing units on the mainland,
                away from the city.

                Despite its uncertain success, Forest City is one of several new urban developments in Malaysia
                aimed at boosting the regional economy; others include Puteri Harbour and the Melaka Gateway.
                This forms part of a national economic strategy to rebrand the country to foreign investors and
                leverage the country’s proximity to Singapore.

                Walking down the main commercial street in the evening after 8pm, there are no open shops or
                restaurants to be found. The only option is the restaurant at the only hotel. No life in the
                buildings—or between them, for that matter. One can only wonder why anyone wanted them there in
                the first place.
