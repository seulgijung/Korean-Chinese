                        Forest City boasts luxurious condos with sea views. Views to be enjoyed from afar, for if you
                        walk along the seafront you will be met with warning signs that read “NO SWIMMING”. So much for
                        going to the beach. But as it turns out––no one is really planning to.

                        The urban mega development, consisting of a concrete superstructure covering four newly created
                        islands, at the southern tip of Malaysia in the Johor Strait, spans over 1700 hectares,
                        equivalent to about half the size of Central Park. It is a private gated property built by one
                        of the largest property development companies in China, Country Garden Pacific View.

                Condo towers are scattered across the
                island. Draped in greenery, they dot the city skyline––yet remain empty. Many choose to purchase
                property in Forest City, but for most it will not even serve as a landing pad. The current
                occupancy rates are low: those who have bought in have been enticed by the prospective returns
                on their investment rather than the prospect of living there.</p><br><br>

                The liveliest place in town is the Forest City showroom on the main island: a large open space
                with mock-up condos, created so that you can almost imagine yourself living there. They are
                complete with scribbled post-it notes on unplugged fridges and models posing as family in framed
                photos. The showroom is busy with sales representatives, and prospective buyers, most of whom
                are visitors from China. A large gong sits in the corner and is hit in celebration each time a
                condo sale is closed—the only live music to be heard on the island. haha

                The developers advertise promises of a smart and green city which resolves many ills of urban
                life, from pollution to traffic congestion. Even an underground transportation network is said
                to be planned, leaving room for pedestrians above ground.

                Although economically enticing, this project presents significant environmental and social cost.
                Swimming at the beach, as tempting as it sounds, is not recommended because of the risk of
                crocodiles roaming. Their habitat was disrupted to make way for the condos; before swaths of
                sand were posed in the area, it was covered in dense mangroves home to a rich variety of
                wildlife. Being built entirely from scratch, it is a resource-intensive endeavor. Its
                construction is dependent on migrant laborers who live in shared housing units on the mainland,
                away from the city.

                Despite its uncertain success, Forest City is one of several new urban developments in Malaysia
                aimed at boosting the regional economy; others include Puteri Harbour and the Melaka Gateway.
                This forms part of a national economic strategy to rebrand the country to foreign investors and
                leverage the country’s proximity to Singapore.

                Walking down the main commercial street in the evening after 8pm, there are no open shops or
                restaurants to be found. The only option is the restaurant at the only hotel. No life in the
                buildings—or between them, for that matter. One can only wonder why anyone wanted them there in
                the first place.
